### Changed
- The chat's `/` menu lists the commands that run in the terminal apart, last, under Terminal
  commands, each with a Terminal badge, as the PC's command catalog describes them. Pick or type
  one and send it normally: once accepted, the pane's own terminal opens over the chat, in this
  browser only, while the chat stays where you were reading and the pane stays on Chat. A head
  says what ran, with Back to Chat and Keep Terminal; the header's Chat, Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+J and a
  phone's Back return too, and Escape goes to the agent. On a desktop the message box stays under
  the terminal, dimmed; on a phone the key bar takes its place. Claude Code's panels (`/config`,
  `/permissions`, `/theme` and the like) can bring the chat back by themselves when you close them,
  once Claude records it; every other command and agent returns by hand. A Ran in terminal row's
  Open Terminal shows the terminal over the chat again. Busy commands stay queued; only an
  explicit Send now opens the terminal, never automatic delivery. Refused sends keep their draft
  and note. Watch-only devices never send or open it, and /resume still opens Earlier sessions.
  Commands the agent's own menu hides are not listed, but still go when typed by hand.
- For an OpenCode pane whose skills are `@` attachments, the `@` menu lists them under Skills
  before the files, and picking one inserts the skill's id.
